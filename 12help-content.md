# User Help

Help may be obsolete as a system. Help in 2015 consists of Youtube, Google, and user forums. And successful use of help requires skill in navigating these three generic resources, none of which are the domain of the application developer. On the other hand, the requirement to add a help system may be foisted upon an application developer. How do you react to such a requirement? Does your reaction differ depending on the users and whether they form a natural community? Does it differ on the basis of sensitivity of data in the application? As an example, I developed an application for which I was not permitted to see the data that would be entered into it. I was asked to use proxy data of a non-sensitive nature and to develop that data myself so that any publicly available documents would not be contaminated by domain expertise and thus become a target of adversaries. How would you react to this?

Why is help for development tools often better than for other software? Is it because developers believe that being helpful popularizes their tools? Is it because there is a natural community feeling between developers of developer tools and their customers, who are also developers?

One way that developers help users is to put employees into forums. This approach may not only help users but also may put the employee in the position of becoming a user advocate and a user expert.

Forums have a character. For instance, some people say that MSDN forums and documents are dry. One student supposes that MS outsources forum help, promoting uniformity of style as a way to keep contractors from forging a forum identity not congruent with corporate goals.

What are successful communities? Steam? Reddit? Stack Overflow? What makes a community successful? Passion for the product? Wanting to be connected to a product? Luck? One student reports that the oldest surviving community he has joined is `overclock.net` but opinions vary as to how it has survived without a schism for so long. Details about the history of Stack Overflow are plentiful since one of its co-founders is the prolific software blogger Joel Spolsky.

Time is a key issue in help. Some software has no version number, such as Google docs. It may change at any moment. If a user experiences trouble with such software, and looks at posts on Stack Overflow, there is no way to associate the date of a post to a particular version of the software. Locking and closing topics may help solve timing issues if moderators have some incentive to keep watch and forum software is easy to use.

Django exemplifies how software with versions can tackle the problem of timely help. Version numbers occur in its help menu, along with warnings at the top of help pages that are very old (unsupported) or very new (largely untested).

Examples of companies with strong help in the gaming industry may include Jagex, Valve, and From Software. Blizzard maintains extreme control over their help offerings, evidently rejecting help from the community. The foregoing is based on student reports.
