The following sections are appendices---you've reached the end of the lecture material. Most of what follows is practical material you'll use for your project, exercises, and exams. The most important part of the course is your project. Before you start looking at the resources associated with the project, look at the linked Hacker News conversation about the question of
[Automating CRUD Web UI construction](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15429616). It includes spirited arguments about layers, abstraction, whether and to what degree automating web ui construction happens in different current workplace environments. It will help you think about what you are doing as you work through your project milestones and exercises.

The appendices include

- Node.js materials, including two hello world tutorials, a simple mysql application, and some information about using Node.js with databases
- Project milestones
- Exams
- Exercises
- Software used in this course
- Pointers to resources on writing well
- References

You should refer to these appendices throughout the semester, using the table of contents tab available in most pdf viewers. You can plan your work better if you familiarize yourself with these appendices early in the semester.
